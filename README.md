# Elliptic Curve Project

## This academic project shows the skill of working with long arithmetic's library â€“ GMP.

## The elliptic curve from this project is presented in Jacobi form. All computations are preestimated and covered by tests.

### To build and run this project make simple instructions:
### 0. If you don't have GMP library on your computer, you can download it from official website: https://gmplib.org
### 1. In Terminal (or PowerShell/GitBash etc.) go to the folder with source code
### 2. Run command-wise nex five commands to build and run executable file:
```console
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./EllipticCurve
```
